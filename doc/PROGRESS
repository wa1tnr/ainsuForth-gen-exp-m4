  18 June 02:05z:

  Pushed one out -- a primitive Forth now exists.  Program is
  no longer marked as broken; program is no longer broken.

  It does something.  Interactively.  Sign on and see, after
  uploading to the Arduino M0+ family (M0 Pro, Adafruit Feather M0
  series, and so on).



  17 June 19:32z:

  Created src/kernel/interpreter.cpp (and accompanying .h file).

  Will work on stacks.cpp next (has dStack_push() and friends).

  11 June 21:36z:

  Copied the entire src/kernel tree from ainsuForthTest into
  ainsuForth and satisfied anything the compiler wanted.  The
  source compiles in both trees.

  Test version: Sketch uses 27496 bytes (10%) of program storage space.
  This version: Sketch uses 9552 bytes (3%) of program storage space.

  The difference: this version is deliberately made smaller; the
  test version is the full program source (basically the new src/kernel
  tree is there, compiled against the YAFFA author's source, with
  appropriate #include #ifdef #ifndef directives to the C preprocessor,
  to avoid multiple definitions, since src/kernel is the same source
  that is found in the base directory of YAFFA (as distributed).

  The whole point of this is to reduce the dictionary (and therefore,
  program) size significantly, for lighter programs that will not
  leverage the (rather complete) Forth from the YAFFA author.

  The approach is to use #include and #define and #ifdef #ifndef and
  so on, to exclude unwanted code (hopefully in a single compiler
  directive, per unwanted Forth word).


  Earlier:

  The warm word is present now.  Allows a warm boot from
  the command line.

  Words with individual source files, now in
  src/kernel include:

      do_sys.cpp do_sys.h dot_quote.cpp dot_quote.h
      drop.cpp drop.h eq.cpp eq.h exit.cpp exit.h
      jump.cpp jump.h leave_sys.cpp leave_sys.h
      literal.cpp literal.h loop_sys.cpp loop_sys.h
      over.cpp over.h plus_loop_sys.cpp plus_loop_sys.h
      quit.cpp quit.h s_quote.cpp s_quote.h
      subroutine.cpp subroutine.h throw.cpp throw.h
      type.cpp type.h variable.cpp variable.h warm.cpp
      warm.h zjump.cpp zjump.h

  This was a difficult programming day -- lost the forest
  for the trees.  Settled for a program that compiles and
  seems to function (at least basically).

  No obvious errors seen.

  Cannot remember how this development started in Test instead
  of regular -- the Test environment is easier to (yes ..) test
  the effects of further coding.  The sense of it was, the
  other day, once the Test suite was in place -- that it was in
  its own way almost more to the point than the regular tree was.

  On the other hand, the Test suite is kept more adherent to
  YAFFA (uses multiple .ino files, for example):

        0-Distribution.d      ainsuForthTest.ino      Dictionary.h
        Dictionary.ino        doc                     Error_Codes.h
        LICENSE               README.md               src
        yaffa.h

ainsuForthTest/src/kernel/
  do_sys.cpp
  do_sys.h
  dot_quote.cpp
  dot_quote.h
  quit.cpp
  quit.h

All appear to compile and play their roles in a working
Forth (essentially, this is an unmodified YAFFA-ARM Forth
at this juncture).

The purpose of the test version is to compile the src
directory into the Forth, replacing every function that
is commented-out of the original file with the same code
in a separate file (under src/kernel).

In this way, not too much effort is made to port the code
from the base directory into the src/kernel directory,
in an unverified state.

The ideas seem to be producing expected results.

The Adafruit Feather M0 Express is the hardware tested.
An Arduino M0 Pro is also available.

Wanted: the Metro version of the M0 Express.

NOTE: The obvious difference between the test directory
and the regular one is that the regular one does no
work -- most of the code in it is commented out.  In
the test directory, that is not the case -- all the
code is present -- it is a working Forth.

Had some progress shuffling code around.  A bit too confused
to document what occured, but look near the time of this timestamp
(01:21z as this is written) for the changes (diff from the previous
revisions, which were pushed more than one hour prior).

One thing new: src/kernel/quit.cpp and  src/kernel/quit.h added to
the tree.
