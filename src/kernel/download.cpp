    // August 3, 2017:
    // There was no file captured (at all).  This is just
    // a hook for an unimplemented SPI Flash file download
    // routine.

    // What really happened was a single-word vocabulary
    // was active during the 'download'.

    // The one word in that vocabulary is '\end.' (including
    // the leading backslash and the trailing dot/period
    // symbol).

    // The usual 'throw' was suppressed, so every word sent to
    // the interpreter that is not in the download vocabulary
    // is simply ignored.

    // At the moment, numbers could still be preserved on the
    // stack, even when entered during a 'download'.

    // That behavior has been suppressed -- numbers are detected
    // during a 'download' -- but are simply echo'd.
